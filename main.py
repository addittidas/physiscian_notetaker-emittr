"""
Physician Notetaker Pipeline
A single-file pipeline that demonstrates:
- NER extraction (Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, Prognosis) using spaCy (with fallback rule-based extraction)
- Keyword extraction (simple RAKE-like approach using POS & noun-chunks)
- Summarization templates + optional transformer summarizer hooks (T5/BART placeholders)
- Sentiment analysis + intent detection scaffolding (HuggingFace transformers pipeline placeholders)
- SOAP note generator (rule-based with heuristics + seq2seq placeholder)

This file is meant to be run as a script or executed cell-by-cell in a Jupyter Notebook.

Notes:
- This script uses standard Python libraries and spaCy. Transformer model calls are placed as optional sections because they require downloading models.
- Replace placeholders with your model IDs (e.g., 'facebook/bart-large-cnn', 'google/mt5-small', 'emilyalsentiment/clinical-bert' etc.) when you have internet and HF access.

Setup (run once):
# pip install spacy==3.6.0
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
# pip install transformers sentencepiece torch sklearn

    transcript = '''Physician: Good morning, Ms. Jones. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Iâ€™m doing better, but I still have some discomfort now and then.
Physician: I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?
Patient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic. Out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind, which pushed my car into the one in front.
Physician: That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?
Patient: Yes, I always do.
Physician: What did you feel immediately after the accident?
Patient: At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away.
Physician: Did you seek medical attention at that time?
Patient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didnâ€™t do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.
Physician: How did things progress after that?
Patient: The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really badâ€”I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.
Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?
Patient: Itâ€™s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. Itâ€™s nothing like before, though.
Physician: Thatâ€™s good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?
Patient: No, nothing like that. I donâ€™t feel nervous driving, and I havenâ€™t had any emotional issues from the accident.
Physician: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?
Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasnâ€™t really stopped me from doing anything.
Physician: Thatâ€™s encouraging. Letâ€™s go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain.
[Physical Examination Conducted]
Physician: Everything looks good. Your neck and back have a full range of movement, and thereâ€™s no tenderness or signs of lasting damage. Your muscles and spine seem to be in good condition.
Patient: Thatâ€™s a relief!
Physician: Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, Iâ€™d expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.
Patient: Thatâ€™s great to hear. So, I donâ€™t need to worry about this affecting me in the future?
Physician: Thatâ€™s right. I donâ€™t foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, youâ€™re on track for a full recovery.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.
Physician: Youâ€™re very welcome, Ms. Jones. Take care, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.'''
